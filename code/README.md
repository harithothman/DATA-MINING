# Title: Research Lead - Data Mining for Classification in Python

I, Harith Hakim, served as the lead researcher tasked with exploring the utilization of data mining techniques for classification tasks in Python. Throughout the project, I delved into various methodologies and Python libraries to develop effective classification models. The research aimed to identify best practices for leveraging Python's capabilities in data mining for classification purposes. Through experimentation and evaluation, our findings contribute to understanding how Python can be utilized for classification tasks using data mining techniques.
